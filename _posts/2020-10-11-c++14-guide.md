This article is the second part of a series of modern C++ development guides.

One might question the need for this series, as there are many books and articles on the topic already. The everyday C++ programmer is proficient and applies coding to real world problems; they may not have time to read a whole book on the topic, or do the research required to separate the useful features from the obscure.  They ideally want to write safe, elegant, performant code, but getting results is top priority; general rules of thumb are therefore more useful than longwinded case explanations.

The opinioned references out there are either non-comprehensive, too basic, or cater to programmers with more advanced library-building use cases.  What's lacking is a frank assessment of C++11 features for the everyday programmer – advice and general rules for how to easily become a better C++ programmer using the improved modern C++ toolsets.
This article series is intended to fill that role, by offering brief definitions, examples, and practical advice for each new feature in roughly sorted order of importance.

# Introduction
{:.no_toc}
The C++ language is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world[^TIOBE].  In 1998, the first standard International Standards Organization (ISO) C++ version was published, known as C++98.  No significant updates were made for 13 years, and full compiler support took longer – making C++98 the traditional version of the language for many programmers.

The updates made in 2011 for C++11 were so substantial that creator Bjarne Stroustrup stated "C++11 feels like a new language … the pieces just fit better together" [^StroustrupC11].  While this is definitely a good thing, transitioning to what "feels like a new language" may seem burdensome for the busy programmer. The significant step up from C++98 to C++11 was covered in a [previous article in the series](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide) - this much shorter article will cover C++14, a smaller release made for bug fixes and small improvements on the C++11 standard.

More complete definitions and examples should be sought in other references. All opinions are my own, based on experience mixed with thoughts from foremost C++ experts such as Bjarne Stroustrup [^StroustrupC11], Herb Sutter [^SutterElts], and Scott Meyers [^MeyersModern].  I have extensively used their ideas and examples to present in this format, and so will not always cite inline.  The reader should carefully consider all information and form their own opinions.

# Critical Changes

{: .box-warning}
Notably, there are no critical changes in C++14! After the massive C++11 update, C++14 contains only small improvements.

## std::make_unique()
However, `std::make_unique()` has been added to the `unique_ptr` critical change from C++11. This is an important function for making sure the memory is correctly managed, and so it was advised to be manually added if you have C++11 but not C++14 - now you don't have to.

See [C++11 smart pointer section](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide/#smart-pointers) for more.

### Advice
{: .no_toc}
* ___Always___ use ```std::make_unique()``` or construct the smart pointer around the created pointer with no other expressions happening between or concurrently.

# Important Features

## Code Safety / Bug Catchers
There are no code safety additions to C++14. :no_mouth:

## More Power

### Quoted Strings

#### Definition

#### Advice

### Generic Lambda Expressions

#### Definition

#### Advice

## Make Coding Better

### Digit Separators

#### Definition
{: .no_toc}

#### Advice
{: .no_toc}

### Binary Literals

#### Definition
{: .no_toc}
C++ has many different number literal representations, including the following:

```c++
123.4f	// float
123U 	// unsigned
0x7b 	// hexadecimal
0173 	// octal
```

C++14 adds binary literals for convenience in representing base-2 numbers. To make a number more readable, use a [digit separator](#digit-separators) to group by fours, starting from the right.

```c++
0b111'1011	// 123 in binary
```

#### Advice
{: .no_toc}
* Use binary literals when working with numbers logically _as binary_ instead of decimal
* Hexadecimal literals might be more useful/readable, depending on the application

### Deprecated Attribute

#### Definition
{: .no_toc}
Attributes were [added in C++11](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide/#attributes). A useful attribute was added in C++14, `[[deprecated]]`. As the name implies, when attached to a function or class, any user code attempting to use it will generate a deprecation compiler warning, `-Wdeprecated-declarations` in _g++_.


#### Advice
{: .no_toc}
* Deprecated functions or classes should be removed if possible
* If not, use `[[deprecated]]` to warn users against using it
  * If warnings are elevated to errors (e.g., `-Werror` in _g++_), de-escalate deprecation back to warning so users aren't automatically broken (`-Wno-error-deprecated-declarations`)

# Templated Library Development Features
* decltype(auto)
* variable templates



# Feature List
* lambda capture initializers
* return type deduction
* relaxing constraints on constexpr functions. no longer const?
* user-defined literals for std lib types
* compile-time integer sequences
* dual-range algorithms
