This article is the second part of a series of modern C++ development guides.

* [C++11](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide)
* _C++14 (this guide)_

One might question the need for this series, as there are many books and articles on the topic already. The everyday C++ programmer is proficient and applies coding to real world problems; they may not have time to read a whole book on the topic, or do the research required to separate the useful features from the obscure.  They ideally want to write safe, elegant, performant code, but getting results is top priority; general rules of thumb are therefore more useful than longwinded case explanations.

The opinioned references out there are either non-comprehensive, too basic, or cater to programmers with more advanced library-building use cases.  What's lacking is a frank assessment of C++11 features for the everyday programmer – advice and general rules for how to easily become a better C++ programmer using the improved modern C++ toolsets.
This article series is intended to fill that role, by offering brief definitions, examples, and practical advice for each new feature in roughly sorted order of importance.

# Introduction
{:.no_toc}
The C++ language is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world[^TIOBE].  In 1998, the first standard International Standards Organization (ISO) C++ version was published, known as C++98.  No significant updates were made for 13 years, and full compiler support took longer – making C++98 the traditional version of the language for many programmers.

The updates made in 2011 for C++11 were so substantial that creator Bjarne Stroustrup stated "C++11 feels like a new language … the pieces just fit better together" [^StroustrupC11].  While this is definitely a good thing, transitioning to what "feels like a new language" may seem burdensome for the busy programmer. The significant step up from C++98 to C++11 was covered in a [previous article in the series](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide) - this much shorter article will cover C++14, a smaller release made for bug fixes and small improvements on the C++11 standard.

More complete definitions and examples should be sought in other references. All opinions are my own, based on experience mixed with thoughts from foremost C++ experts such as Bjarne Stroustrup [^StroustrupC11], Herb Sutter [^SutterElts], and Scott Meyers [^MeyersModern].  I have extensively used their ideas and examples to present in this format, and so will not always cite inline.  The reader should carefully consider all information and form their own opinions.

# Critical Changes

{: .box-warning}
Notably, there are no critical changes in C++14! After the massive C++11 update, C++14 contains only small improvements. :no_mouth:

## std::make_unique()
However, `std::make_unique()` has been added to the `unique_ptr` critical change from C++11. This is an important function for making sure the memory is correctly managed, and so it was advised to be manually added if you have C++11 but not C++14 - now you don't have to.

See [C++11 smart pointer section](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide/#smart-pointers) for more.

### Advice
{: .no_toc}
* ___Always___ use ```std::make_unique()``` or construct the smart pointer around the created pointer with no other expressions occurring in the same line.

# Important Features

## Code Safety / Bug Catchers
There are no code safety additions to C++14. :no_mouth:

### Hetereogeneous Associative Container Lookup

#### Definition
{: .no_toc}
This one certainly sounds complicated, and the code is less than straight-forward; but conceptually it's not too bad.

Heterogeneous
: Different in type

Associative container
: Ordered associative array
: A variable-sized container that supports efficient retrieval of elements (values) based on keys, and maintains elements in order
: `set`, `map`, `multiset`, `multimap`

Lookup
: Attempting to find a given key in the container

So taken together, it simply means you can do a lookup in a `map` or `set` with a key that has a different type than the keys in the container.

Why would you want this? Well, it allows you to store large user-created classes with a single identifier property in a `set` and not have to create a whole instance of the class to use as the lookup key.

Here's an example of the old way, where a class with a large memory footprint is stored in a `set`. The comparison used in creation of the set (`operator <`) compares name only. In order to count the number of `MemoryIntensiveUser`s with a particular name, we will have to create a `MemoryIntensiveUser` first, even though the comparison only uses the name field.
```c++
// Large user class that has a single name identifier
class MemoryIntensiveUser
{
	string name;

	// Lots more storage here...

	MemoryIntensiveUser(string name) :
		name(name) {}

	bool operator< (const User& rhs)
	{
		return this->name < rhs.name;
	}
};
set<User> users;
...

// Wasteful to create a whole instance when we
//	only use the name for comparison
MemoryIntensiveUser lookupUser("Bill Adama");
cout << users.count(lookupUser);
```

Now, we could instead make it a `map` and use `name` as the key, but that will unnecessarily duplicate storage of the name field.

So, let's see that C++14 heterogeneous lookup in action. Ultimately, we just have to add the ability to compare an instance of `MemoryIntensiveUser` with a `string`, and vice versa. We could even add other probe types like c-string for example.  There are two ways to do this, the first being to provide additional overloads of `operator <`, and then creating the `set` with the no-type comparison function object [`less<>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/less) [^KierasHeteroLookup].

```c++
bool operator< (const MemoryIntensiveUser& lhs, const string& rhs)
{
	return lhs.name < rhs;
}
bool operator< (const string& lhs, const MemoryIntensiveUser& rhs)
{
	return lhs < rhs.name;
}

// Provide no-type specialization of less<T>
set<MemoryIntensiveUser, less<>> users;
...

// Lookup using string literal, no MemoryIntensiveUser required
cout << users.count("Bill Adama"s);
```

Note the string literal (******** TODO********)

The second approach is to create a custom comparison function object (functor), which may be preferred if you don't want to pollute the global namespace with the additional operators defined. It looks similar to what we did before - except wrapped in a functor of course - but there is one bizarre addition that is required for compilation. The `using is_transparent` business tells the `set` class to allow heterogeneous lookup by defining new function signatures for `find`, `count`, and others. This is not pretty, but was apparently necessary to prevent breaking other code using `set`.

```c++
struct UserNameComparison
{
	// Weird, but required
	using is_transparent = std::true_type;

	bool operator< (const MemoryIntensiveUser& lhs,
					const MemoryIntensiveUser& rhs)
	{
		return lhs.name < rhs.name;
	}
	bool operator< (const MemoryIntensiveUser& lhs, const string& rhs)
	{
		return lhs.name < rhs;
	}
	bool operator< (const string& lhs, const MemoryIntensiveUser& rhs)
	{
		return lhs < rhs.name;
	}
};

// Provide custom heterogeneous-lookup functor
set<MemoryIntensiveUser, UserNameComparison> users;
...

// Lookup using string literal, no MemoryIntensiveUser required
cout << users.count("Bill Adama"s);
```

Unfortunately heterogeneous lookup only works on `set` and `map`, not `unordered_set` or `unordered_map`. There have been proposals to add it to the standard but it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.

#### Advice
{: .no_toc}
If storing a large user-defined class which has a single identifier property in a `set`:
* First, consider if using a [hash map or set](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide/#hash-maps-and-sets) would be better than an ordered `set` or `map`. If so, you cannot use heterogeneous lookup
* Add heterogeneous lookup ability if it would be used often and therefore cost efficient
* Prefer the comparison functor approach to avoid minor global namespace pollution

### Quoted Strings

#### Definition
{: .no_toc}
Quoted strings (`std::quoted`) are a pretty niche feature but provide a decent utility nevertheless. They can be used to escape quotes or other characters while traveling roundtrip in an I/O stream. Think of sending a user comment field to a database, SQL query, or CSV file.

All it does is wrap the whole string in `delim` characters and then prepend every instance of `delim` inside the string with `escape`. Note it is used as a stream manipulator, so no separate quoted string is ever actually created.

```c++

std::stringstream ss;
std::string userComment = "It's Baby Yoda not \"The Child\"";
std::cout << userComment; // It's Baby Yoda not "The Child"
std::cout << userComment.size(); // 30

// Quote out the user comment before storage
ss << std::quoted(userComment);
std::cout << ss.str(); // "It's Baby Yoda not \"The Child\"";
std::cout << ss.str().size(); // 34
...

// Now unquote the user comment so it's back to original
std::string userCommentReturned;
ss >> std::quoted(userCommentReturned);
std::cout << userCommentReturned; // It's Baby Yoda not "The Child"
```

#### Advice
{: .no_toc}
* Consider using `std::quoted` for roundtrip stream travel of strings that may contain a certain escape character such as double quote
* But, it's simple and can only do one character; XML quoting, e.g., would need an external library
* ___Not___ a good user-input sanitization solution

## Make Coding Better

### Digit Separators

#### Definition
{: .no_toc}
A single `'` character can be used inside of numbers or user-defined literals to make them easier to read. More typical characters such as `,` or `.` were already used in other contexts so the single quote character was chosen.

It does not have any affect other than improving readability.

```c++
int hardToReadMillion		= 1000000;
int easyToReadyMillion		= 1'000'000;
int easyToReadHex		= 0xface'beef;
int easyToReadOct		= 01'234'567;
double easyToReadDouble		= 8.675'309;
```

#### Advice
{: .no_toc}
* Use digit separators on all numeric literals 6 digits in length or more

### Binary Literals

#### Definition
{: .no_toc}
C++ has many different number literal representations, including the following:

```c++
123.4f	// float
123U 	// unsigned
0x7b 	// hexadecimal
0173 	// octal
```

C++14 adds binary literals for convenience in representing base-2 numbers. To make a number more readable, use a [digit separator](#digit-separators) to group by fours, starting from the right.

```c++
0b111'1011	// 123 in binary
```

#### Advice
{: .no_toc}
* Use binary literals when working with numbers logically _as binary_ instead of decimal
* Hexadecimal literals might be more useful/readable, depending on the application

### Deprecated Attribute

#### Definition
{: .no_toc}
Attributes were [added in C++11](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide/#attributes). A useful attribute was added in C++14, `[[deprecated]]`. As the name implies, when attached to a function or class, any user code attempting to use it will generate a deprecation compiler warning, `-Wdeprecated-declarations` in _g++_.

```c++
[[deprecated("Use new_method instead")]]
void dumb_old_method();
```

#### Advice
{: .no_toc}
* Deprecated functions or classes should be removed if possible
* If not, use `[[deprecated]]` to warn users against using it, providing a reason in the attribute argument
  * If warnings are elevated to errors (e.g., `-Werror` in _g++_), de-escalate deprecation back to warning so users aren't automatically broken (`-Wno-error-deprecated-declarations`)

### User-Defined Literals for Standard Library Types

#### Definition
In the vein of [C++11 User-Defined Literals](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide/#user-defined-literals), some have been created and added to standard library types `basic_string`, `chrono`, and `complex`.

##### basic_string
The suffix `s` on a quoted text string denotes a `std::string` literal, as opposed to a literal C-string as `char[]`.

You should always use the string literal suffix when you intend to have a `std::string`, for these reasons.
1. Type deduction is more accurate.
2. It's possible it may be faster https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18439529/are-basic-string-literals-faster-or-handled-better-at-compile-time
3. Null characters (`'\0'`) are allowed in the string.

``` c++
using namespace std::string_literals;
std::string defaultUser = "Default User"s;
```

##### chrono_literals
Available time duration literals in C++14 include hours (`h`), minutes (`min`), seconds (`sec`), milliseconds (`ms`), microseconds (`us`), and nanoseconds (`ns`). Further literals made available in C++20 are days (`d`), and years (`y`).
```c++
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
std::chrono::minutes minutesToSaveTheWorld = 4.000min;
std::chrono::seconds teslaRoadster0to60 = 1.9s;
std::chrono::hours jackBauersTime = 24h;
```

##### complex_literals
Available complex number literals in C++14 include `double` complex (`i`), `float` complex (`if`), and `long double` complex (`il`). Note that it will create a complex number object with the given number as the imaginary portion but a real portion of 0 - in the example below, the full complex number only exists after 42.0 is added to the imaginary portion 13.
```c++
using namespace std::complex_literals;
std::complex<double> complexNumber = 42.0 + 13i;
```
#### Advice
* ***Always*** use string literal suffix if you want a `std::string`.
* Use `chrono_literals` and `complex_literals` for increased readability when working with literals of these types.

# Templated Library Development Features

## Lambda Upgrades
### Definition
{: .no_toc}

### Advice
* Avoid usage lambdas when possible, see [C++11 advice](../2020-06-14-c++11-guide/#lambdas)


* decltype(auto)

## Variable Templates

### Definition
https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3651.pdf

### Advice

* return type deduction
* generic lambda expressions


# Minor Features

## Compile-Time Integer Sequences
The class template `std::integer_sequence` represents a compile-time sequence of integers, which can be used for template deduction purposes. This can be useful for working with tuples, such as converting an `array` to a `tuple` or unpacking a tuple to apply a function to each element. I don't think it's likely to be a commonly-useful feature.

## Lambda Capture Initializers

## Tuple Type-Addressing


* aggregate initialization works with in-class member initialization
* dual-range algorithms (equals, mismatch, is_permutation) that checks sizes first



# Feature List
* relaxing constraints on constexpr functions. no longer const?
