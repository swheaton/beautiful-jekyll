## New Digs
Well, I finally got around to creating a website and blog! I am using [Github Pages](https://github.com/pages) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which were very easy to set up.  Also I got beautification help from [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).  As a non-GUI developer, this is definitely a Good Thing &TRADE;; there's a non-zero chance a web page I created myself would've contained \<blink\>.

## Topics I will cover
* Coding
* Development Processes
* Miscellaneous nerd stuff
* Anything I want (this is my blog after all and no one is reading anyways)

Cheers
